# Admin_Dashboard

In this project I am going to be creating a dashboard using flexbox and grid. I am going to try and rely mainly on grid as this was the new thing we just learned. Also, I get the sense that flexbox grid is more useful as it seems like it has more control. Another thing, I am going to try and make everything dynamic and use relative units rather than pixels as I want to get better at building responsive websites! Let's get started!!


All Done!
I learned a LOT about css during this project and really dug into my selectors, flexbox, and grid skills. at some point I had every box set up with an overflow but it looked too crowded and unappealing so I took it out. I think what I'm most proud of with this project is that I made this site basically 100% dynamic with em instead of absolute units like px. Up until now my css has been static for the most part. Right on!
